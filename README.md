Neuro is a simple machine learning framework I started developing during my graduate studies at the University of Toronto for learning and educational purposes! Included is an example of a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that learns how to generate a sine function from a uniformly distributed prior.

TODO:
1) Implement some basic reverse-mode automatic diff
2) Implement unit tests
3) Documentation!
